# DevOps From a Noob
Welcome to my repo, where I am going to note all the technologies I have learnt so far in my time as a Cloud DevOps Engineer. I started my journey as a Cloud DevOps Engineer in June 2022, so don't expect too many fireworks, hence why it is DevOps From a Noob.

## What is DevOps?
 DevOps is an amalgamation of `development` and `operations`. It is the combination of tasks performed by an organisation's applications development and systems operations teams. The DevOps software development mehtod emphasises collaboration, communication and integration between developers and other IT personnel with the goal of streamlining software development and quality assurance.
